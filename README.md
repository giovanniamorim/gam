## Microfrontend

In this section, we provide an overview of Micro-Frontends architecture, highlighting its advantages and how it transforms the traditional approach to user interface development.

## GET STARTED

### Viabilities Study

Before starting implementation, conducting a comprehensive feasibility study is crucial. This section covers the following perspectives:

- **Technical Feasibility:** Explores technical aspects related to Micro-Frontends implementation, including technology choices, tool integration, and infrastructure requirements.

- **Managerial Feasibility:** Highlights strategic and financial considerations, alignment with organizational goals, costs, budgeting, change management, and training.

### Implementation

This stage is divided into two subsections:

- **Operational:** Details the practical implementation of Micro-Frontends, including development best practices, directory structure, and integration with CI/CD tools.

- **Integration:** Addresses strategies to efficiently integrate Micro-Frontends with existing systems, ensuring a smooth transition and interoperability.

### Expansion

When considering architecture expansion, we address:

- **Scalability:** Explores strategies to scale the Micro-Frontends architecture as the project grows, maintaining performance and efficiency.

- **Maintainability:** Highlights practices to ensure that the architecture remains easy to maintain and evolve over time.

## Pilot Project

Finally, we discuss the importance of conducting a pilot project before full deployment. This allows testing the architecture in a controlled environment, identifying specific challenges, and refining the overall strategy.
